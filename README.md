##                             The Universal Fraud Detection Strategy with Quantum Machine Learning(QML)
  It's about identifying anomalies in behavioral patterns within any given system. The model doesn't care if the transaction is in Rupees, Bitcoin, or video game gold; it only cares about the data patterns.Think of every user, even an anonymous one, as creating a unique "digital fingerprint" through their actions. Fraud is simply a transaction that doesn't match that user's fingerprint or the overall fingerprint of legitimate users.
## key points:
### 1.Establish a Baseline: 
  Analyze the entire dataset to understand what "normal" behavior looks like. What are the average transaction values, times, and frequencies?
### 2.Engineer System-Specific Features: 
  Identify the key data points available in your anonymous system and use them to create features that highlight unusual behavior.
### 3.Detect the Deviation: 
  Feed these features into your model to find the transactions that are mathematical outliers from the established "normal" baseline.
## Why use QML:
### 1.Classical (Non-Quantum) Fraud Detection Models
  Yes, these models not only existâ€”they are a massive, highly advanced, multi-billion dollar industry.Every single time you swipe your card, make an online payment, or transfer money, your transaction is being scrutinized in real-time by incredibly sophisticated machine learning models.
   **Who Uses Them: Banks (HDFC, SBI), credit card networks (Visa, Mastercard), payment gateways (Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal), and e-commerce giants (Amazon, Flipkart) all have large teams dedicated to this.
