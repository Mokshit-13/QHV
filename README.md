##                             The Universal Fraud Detection Strategy with Quantum Machine Learning(QML)
  It's about identifying anomalies in behavioral patterns within any given system. The model doesn't care if the transaction is in Rupees, Bitcoin, or video game gold; it only cares about the data patterns.Think of every user, even an anonymous one, as creating a unique "digital fingerprint" through their actions. Fraud is simply a transaction that doesn't match that user's fingerprint or the overall fingerprint of legitimate users.
## key points:
#### 1.Establish a Baseline: 
  Analyze the entire dataset to understand what "normal" behavior looks like. What are the average transaction values, times, and frequencies?
#### 2.Engineer System-Specific Features: 
  Identify the key data points available in your anonymous system and use them to create features that highlight unusual behavior.
#### 3.Detect the Deviation: 
  Feed these features into your model to find the transactions that are mathematical outliers from the established "normal" baseline.
## why use QML:
#### 1.Classical (Non-Quantum) Fraud Detection Models
  Yes, these models not only exist—they are a massive, highly advanced, multi-billion dollar industry.Every single time you swipe your card, make an online payment, or transfer money, your transaction is being scrutinized in real-time by incredibly sophisticated machine learning models.
   **Who Uses Them: Banks (HDFC, SBI), credit card networks (Visa, Mastercard), payment gateways (Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal), and e-commerce giants (Amazon, Flipkart) all have large teams dedicated to this.
#### 2. Quantum (QML) Fraud Detection Models
 Yes, these models exist, but almost exclusively in research and development, not in production.If the model is bulit it will be even faster and accurate than the classical models,and can handle much data load at once and process better the existing classical model.
### so why?? :
#### Future-Proofing:
   Everyone knows that quantum computing will eventually be a disruptive force. By working on these problems now, companies and governments are building the algorithms and knowledge they will need when the hardware is ready.
#### Discovering Quantum Advantage: 
  Nobody yet knows for sure which specific types of fraud a quantum computer will be best at finding. Is it better at detecting complex money laundering rings? Or subtle forms of identity theft? Hackathons like this are a way to explore the possibilities.
#### Talent Development: 
  The single biggest bottleneck in quantum computing right now is the lack of trained people. The hackathon's primary goal is to train you—the next generation of quantum developers, researchers, and engineers in India.
